    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

    <p><em>Nectar in a Sieve</em> by Kamala Markandaya chronicles the life of Rukmani, a woman in rural India, as she navigates the challenges of poverty, family, and societal change. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly transforming India, where traditional agrarian life clashes with the encroachment of industrialisation.</p>

    <p>Rukmani, married to Nathan, a tenant farmer, endures a life of hardship and resilience. She experiences the joys of motherhood but also the devastating losses of children. She witnesses the beauty and bounty of nature alongside the cruelty of famine and drought. The arrival of a tannery in their village symbolises the disruptive force of progress, bringing both opportunities and exploitation.</p>

    <p>As the tannery expands, it displaces farmers and alters the social fabric of the village. Rukmani and Nathan, along with their children, confront the harsh realities of a changing world. They grapple with poverty, loss, and the disintegration of their traditional way of life. Despite these trials, Rukmani's unwavering spirit and deep connection to the land provide a source of strength and hope.</p>

    <p>The story illuminates the human cost of progress and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Through Rukmani's poignant narration, the novel paints a vivid portrait of rural India and the lives of those caught in the tide of change.</p>
