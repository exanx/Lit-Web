      "To a Snowdrop" is a sonnet by William Wordsworth, written sometime between 1803 and 1814. The poem focuses on the snowdrop, a small, white flower that is one of the first to bloom in spring. Wordsworth uses the snowdrop as a symbol of hope, resilience, and the fleeting nature of beauty.

    <div class="poem-container">
        Lone Flower, hemmed in with snows and white as they<br>
        But hardier far, once more I see thee bend<br>
        Thy forehead, as if fearful to offend,<br>
        Like an unbidden guest. Though day by day,<br>
        <br>
        Storms, sallying from the mountain-tops, waylay<br>
        The rising sun, and on the plains descend;<br>
        Yet art thou welcome, welcome as a friend<br>
        Whose zeal outruns his promise! Blue-eyed May<br>
        <br>
        Shall soon behold this border thickly set<br>
        With bright jonquils, their odours lavishing<br>
        On the soft west-wind and his frolic peers;<br>
        Nor will I then thy modest grace forget,<br>
        Chaste Snowdrop, venturous harbinger of Spring,<br>
        And pensive monitor of fleeting years!
    </div>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem begins by addressing the snowdrop as a "Lone Flower," highlighting its isolation amidst the remaining snow. Wordsworth admires its hardiness, as it blooms despite the harsh conditions of early spring. The snowdrop is personified as being "fearful to offend," like a guest who has arrived uninvited. The speaker welcomes the snowdrop as a "friend," appreciating its resilience in the face of storms that "waylay" the rising sun.  The poem then shifts to a future time when "Blue-eyed May" arrives, bringing with it brighter and more fragrant flowers like jonquils. While these flowers will soon dominate the landscape, the speaker promises not to forget the "modest grace" of the snowdrop. The poem concludes by praising the snowdrop as a "venturous harbinger of Spring" and a reminder of the "fleeting years."

    <h2 id="structure-style">Structure and Style</h2>
    <p>
      "To a Snowdrop" is a sonnet, a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme and structure. Wordsworth uses the Petrarchan sonnet form, which is divided into an octave (eight lines) and a sestet (six lines). The octave establishes the scene and introduces the snowdrop, while the sestet reflects on its significance. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Octave:</strong> Introduces the snowdrop and the harsh conditions it faces. It establishes a sense of sympathy for the flower's struggle to survive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sestet:</strong> Shifts the focus to the future arrival of spring and the more showy jonquils. Despite their beauty, the speaker vows to remember the snowdrop's unique qualities. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABBAABBA CDCDCD. This structure creates a sense of balance and harmony, even as the poem explores the contrast between the delicate snowdrop and the powerful forces of nature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Wordsworth utilizes various poetic techniques to elevate the poem and convey its meaning:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Personification:</strong>  The snowdrop is given human qualities, such as being "fearful to offend" and having "modest grace." This technique makes the flower more relatable and allows the reader to connect with its struggle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Imagery:</strong> Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to create a strong impression of the snowdrop and its environment. Words like "hemmed in," "sallying," "waylay," and "lavishing" paint a picture of the flower's delicate beauty amidst the harsh conditions of early spring.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> The phrase "Blue-eyed May" is a metaphor for the month of May, personifying it as a gentle and welcoming figure. This metaphor emphasizes the contrast between the harshness of early spring and the beauty of full bloom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Symbolism:</strong> The snowdrop is a symbol of hope, resilience, and the fleeting nature of beauty. Its ability to bloom despite the cold and snow represents the enduring power of life.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
    <p>
     The poem explores several key themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Resilience and Hope:</strong> The snowdrop's ability to survive and thrive in harsh conditions represents the enduring power of life and the importance of hope, even in the face of adversity. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Fleeting Nature of Beauty:</strong>  While the snowdrop is beautiful, its bloom is short-lived. This transience serves as a reminder of the preciousness of beauty and the inevitability of change.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Appreciation of Simple Things:</strong>  Wordsworth encourages the reader to appreciate the beauty of even the smallest and most common things in nature. The snowdrop, though humble, possesses a unique grace that should not be overlooked.
      </li>
