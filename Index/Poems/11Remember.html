    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      "Remember" is a sonnet by Christina Rossetti, exploring themes of death, memory, and the complexities of grief. The poem, addressed to a loved one, navigates the speaker's conflicting desires to be remembered and the potential pain that remembrance might inflict after their passing. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="poem">Poem</h2>
    <div class="poem-container">
        Remember me when I am gone away,<br>
        Gone far away into the silent land;<br>
        When you can no more hold me by the hand,<br>
        Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.<br>
        <br>
        Remember me when no more day by day<br>
        You tell me of our future that you plann'd:<br>
        Only remember me; you understand<br>
        It will be late to counsel then or pray.<br>
        <br>
        Yet if you should forget me for a while<br>
        And afterwards remember, do not grieve:<br>
        For if the darkness and corruption leave<br>
        A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,<br>
        <br>
        Better by far you should forget and smile<br>
        Than that you should remember and be sad.
    </div>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem starts with a direct plea: "Remember me when I am gone away," setting a melancholic tone and introducing the theme of mortality. The speaker acknowledges the finality of death, describing it as a journey to the "silent land" where earthly connections are severed.  The speaker then contrasts this inevitable separation with memories of their shared past, including plans for a future that will remain unfulfilled.  
      <br><br>
       While initially desiring to be remembered, the speaker experiences a shift in the sestet. The speaker acknowledges that remembering might cause the loved one pain. Therefore, they express a preference for being forgotten entirely, urging their loved one to "forget and smile" rather than "remember and be sad". This conflicting desire reveals a selfless love concerned with the well-being of the beloved even after death.
    </p>

    <h2 id="structure-style">Structure and Style</h2>
    <p>
     "Remember" follows the structure of a Petrarchan sonnet, with its 14 lines divided into an octave (eight lines) and a sestet (six lines). The octave establishes the speaker's initial plea for remembrance and reflects on the separation brought by death. The sestet introduces a shift in perspective, prioritizing the loved one's emotional well-being over the speaker's desire to be remembered.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Octave:</strong> Focuses on the speaker's desire to be remembered by their loved one after death. It emphasizes the finality of death and the loss of physical presence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sestet:</strong> Transitions to a more complex perspective, considering the potential burden of remembrance on the loved one. It emphasizes the speaker's selfless love, wanting their loved one to find peace and happiness even in their absence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The rhyme scheme of the poem, ABBAABBA CDECDE, creates a sense of order and finality. It reinforces the theme of inevitable separation and acceptance of death's finality.
    </p>

    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Rossetti employs several poetic techniques to enhance the poem's emotional impact:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Repetition:</strong>  The word "remember" appears throughout the poem, emphasizing the speaker's initial desire to remain in their loved one's memory.  However, the later shift towards a preference for being forgotten adds layers of complexity to this repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direct Address:</strong> The speaker directly addresses their loved one, creating an intimate and conversational tone.  This personalizes the themes of death and remembrance, making them more emotionally resonant for the reader.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Imagery:</strong> Rossetti uses evocative imagery, such as "gone away into the silent land" and "the darkness and corruption," to paint a vivid picture of death's realm and its separation from the world of the living. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Juxtaposition:</strong> The contrasting ideas of remembering and forgetting are juxtaposed throughout the poem. This highlights the speaker's internal conflict between their desire to be remembered and their understanding of the potential pain it might cause. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
    <p>
      "Remember" explores several interconnected themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Mortality and Remembrance:</strong> The poem confronts the inevitability of death and the human desire to be remembered after passing.  The speaker's initial plea to be remembered highlights this universal longing for a lasting presence in the memories of loved ones. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Love and Selflessness:</strong>  The speaker's willingness to be forgotten for the sake of their loved one's happiness demonstrates a profound and selfless love. Their priority shifts from personal desire to concern for the emotional well-being of the one left behind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Complexity of Grief:</strong> The poem acknowledges that grief is not a straightforward process. The speaker recognizes that remembrance can bring pain as well as comfort. It suggests that true love might involve letting go, allowing the loved one to heal and move on.
      </li>
    </ul>
