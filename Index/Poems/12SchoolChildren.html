    <p>
      "Among School Children" is a meditative poem by William Butler Yeats, exploring the interconnectedness of youth, age, memory, and the nature of beauty and art.  Inspired by a visit to a convent school, the poem moves between observations of the schoolchildren and the speaker's reflections on his own life and the fleeting nature of time.  It grapples with the complexities of human experience, questioning how beauty and meaning can endure in the face of mortality.

      I<br>
      I walk through the long schoolroom questioning;<br>
      A kind old nun in a white hood replies;<br>
      The children learn to cipher and to sing,<br>
      To study reading-books and history,<br>
      To cut and sew, be neat in everything<br>
      In the best modern way—the children’s eyes<br>
      In momentary wonder stare upon<br>
      A sixty-year-old smiling public man.<br>
      <br>
      II<br>
      I dream of a Ledaean body, bent<br>
      Above a sinking fire, a tale that she<br>
      Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event<br>
      That changed some childish day to tragedy—<br>
      Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent<br>
      Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,<br>
      Or else, to alter Plato’s parable,<br>
      Into the yolk and white of the one shell.<br>
      <br>
      III<br>
      And thinking of that fit of grief or rage<br>
      I look upon one child or t’other there<br>
      And wonder if she stood so at that age—<br>
      For even daughters of the swan can share<br>
      Something of every paddler’s heritage—<br>
      And had that colour upon cheek or hair,<br>
      And thereupon my heart is driven wild:<br>
      She stands before me as a living child.<br>
      <br>
      IV<br>
      Her present image floats into the mind—<br>
      Did Quattrocento finger fashion it<br>
      Lady, their fingers move in this or that, <br>
      Found it or made it, for I could not tell <br>
      How sensitive the Child, how bold the hand <br>
      That held the brush and measured out the spot <br>
      Mother and child in one, the little creature,<br>
      To paint that ivory, that the loveliness <br>
      Of the pupil and the painted image blending <br>
      From the holy statues of the Mother of God.<br>
      <br>
      V<br>
      And yet I know that as I gaze upon it now, <br>
      And think of that— this— that— the other thing, <br>
      The more I think, the more I am convinced <br>
      That everything that’s written or designed <br>
      To make the soul less mournful comes to this, <br>
      That dying generations weigh upon us. <br>
      O body swayed to music, O brightening glance, <br>
      How can we know the dancer from the dance?

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem opens with the speaker, an aging public figure, visiting a schoolroom. He observes the children engaged in their lessons and is struck by their youthful innocence. This encounter triggers a cascade of memories, transporting him back to his youth and the memory of a beloved woman. He recalls a moment of shared intimacy, where their emotions seemed to merge into one. 
      <br><br>
      Observing the schoolgirls, he wonders if his beloved possessed a similar beauty in her youth.  The image of her as a child overwhelms him. His thoughts then shift to artistic representations of mothers and children, particularly Renaissance paintings and sculptures of the Virgin Mary and Child.  He contemplates the artist's ability to capture such beauty and the timeless quality of these works. 
      <br><br>
      The poem concludes with a philosophical reflection on the nature of art and its relationship to life and death. The speaker suggests that all great art seeks to offer solace in the face of mortality. He questions the separation between creator and creation, the "dancer" and the "dance," proposing that they might be ultimately inseparable, a unified expression of beauty and human experience. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="structure-style">Structure and Style</h2>
    <p>
     "Among School Children" is composed of five stanzas of varying length, with a rhyme scheme that shifts throughout the poem. This irregularity in structure mirrors the speaker's stream of consciousness and the meandering path of his memories and reflections. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza I:</strong> Introduces the setting and the speaker's initial observations of the schoolchildren. The simple, direct language reflects the straightforward nature of the scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza II:</strong> Transitions into the speaker's memories, introducing the image of his beloved and a moment of shared intimacy.  The language becomes more lyrical and evocative. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza III:</strong> The speaker connects his memories to the present, seeing his beloved reflected in the schoolgirls. The emotional intensity increases, marked by exclamations and questions. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza IV:</strong> Shifts to a contemplation of art, specifically imagery of mothers and children. The language is rich with sensory details and allusions to Renaissance art. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza V:</strong>  Expands into a broader philosophical reflection on the nature of art, life, and death. The language is more abstract and contemplative. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Yeats employs various poetic techniques to convey the poem's complexity:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Imagery:</strong> Vivid imagery throughout the poem evokes the speaker's sensory experiences and memories, from the "long schoolroom" to the "sinking fire" and the "holy statues" of the Mother of God. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Allusion:</strong>  The poem is rich with allusions, particularly to Greek mythology ("Ledaean body") and Renaissance art ("Quattrocento finger"). These allusions deepen the poem's meaning and connect it to broader artistic and cultural traditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong>  The metaphor of the "yolk and white of the one shell" represents the merging of the speaker's and his beloved's emotions. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rhetorical Question:</strong> The concluding question, "How can we know the dancer from the dance?", invites the reader to contemplate the interconnectedness of art, life, and the creative process. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
    <p>
      "Among School Children" explores a constellation of interconnected themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Passage of Time and Memory:</strong> The poem meditates on the fleeting nature of time and the power of memory to transport us back to the past. The speaker's encounter with the schoolchildren triggers a flood of memories, highlighting the bittersweet experience of aging and the persistence of the past.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lost Love and Idealized Beauty:</strong>  The speaker's recollections of his beloved are imbued with a sense of longing and idealization.  He sees her beauty reflected in the schoolchildren, blurring the lines between past and present, reality and memory. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Art, Beauty, and Mortality:</strong> The poem contemplates the nature of beauty and the power of art to transcend time and offer solace in the face of mortality. Yeats suggests that art can provide a sense of continuity and connection to the past, even as individuals age and generations pass.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Unity of Being:</strong>  The concluding question, "How can we know the dancer from the dance?", suggests a merging of creator and creation, subject and object. It proposes that beauty and meaning might reside not in separation but in interconnectedness and the ultimate unity of experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
