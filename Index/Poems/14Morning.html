    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
     "Morning at the Window" is a short, poignant poem by T.S. Eliot that captures the bleak and desolate atmosphere of urban life in the early 20th century. Composed in 1914, likely amidst the outbreak of World War I, the poem reflects the disillusionment and alienation that characterized the modernist era. Through vivid imagery and a detached tone, Eliot presents a fragmented and impersonal view of the city, highlighting the isolation and spiritual emptiness of modern existence.

    <div class="poem-container">
      They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,<br>
      And along the trampled edges of the street<br>
      I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids<br>
      Sprouting despondently at area gates.<br>
      The brown waves of fog toss up to me<br>
      Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,<br>
      And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts<br>
      An aimless smile that hovers in the air<br>
      And vanishes along the level of the roofs.
    </div>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem opens with the speaker observing the mundane sounds of city life – the clattering of breakfast plates emanating from "basement kitchens." This immediately establishes a sense of detachment, as the speaker is positioned above, looking down upon the street below. 
      <br><br>
      The speaker then focuses on the "damp souls of housemaids," who appear listless and dispirited, "sprouting despondently at area gates." The imagery of dampness suggests a pervasive sense of gloom and stagnation, highlighting the lack of vitality in urban life. 
      <br><br>
      As the speaker continues to observe the street, the brown fog rises, revealing "twisted faces" that emerge from its depths. This imagery further reinforces the distorted and fragmented nature of the city experience, suggesting a loss of individuality and human connection. 
      <br><br>
      Amidst this bleak scene, the speaker catches a glimpse of "an aimless smile" from a passerby. However, this brief moment of human expression is fleeting, quickly vanishing into the fog and the anonymity of the city. The poem ends on a note of profound isolation, emphasizing the transient and impersonal nature of urban encounters.
    </p>

    <h2 id="structure-style">Structure and Style</h2>
    <p>
      "Morning at the Window" is written in a single stanza, a modified Spenserian stanza, typically consisting of nine lines ending with an alexandrine (a 12-syllable line). However, Eliot breaks from tradition by omitting the rhyme scheme, creating a sense of dissonance and unease that reflects the poem's thematic concerns. The poem's lack of formal structure mirrors the fragmented and chaotic nature of the urban environment it depicts. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Eliot employs several poetic techniques to convey the poem's message of urban alienation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Imagery:</strong> Vivid and often unsettling imagery dominates the poem. The "damp souls" of housemaids, the "twisted faces" in the fog, and the fleeting "aimless smile" all contribute to a sense of bleakness and spiritual emptiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensory Detail:</strong> Eliot engages multiple senses to create a visceral experience for the reader. The clatter of breakfast plates, the brown fog, and the muddy skirts of the passerby all contribute to a sense of urban squalor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Detached Tone:</strong>  The speaker's detached and observational tone emphasizes the sense of isolation and anonymity in the city. The use of the pronoun "they" further contributes to the impersonal nature of the urban environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Symbolism:</strong> The fog serves as a potent symbol of the confusion and spiritual darkness that envelop the city. It obscures human connection and reinforces the sense of alienation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
    <p>
      "Morning at the Window" explores several interconnected themes that reflect the anxieties of the modern world:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Urban Alienation:</strong> Eliot captures the sense of isolation and anonymity that permeates modern city life. Individuals are reduced to mere observers, detached from their surroundings and each other. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spiritual Emptiness:</strong>  The poem suggests a profound spiritual crisis at the heart of modern existence. The "damp souls" and "twisted faces" reflect a loss of meaning and purpose in the face of urban indifference. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Fragility of Human Connection:</strong>  The fleeting smile of the passerby highlights the difficulty of establishing meaningful connections in the impersonal and transient environment of the city.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Disillusionment of Modernity:</strong> The poem reflects the broader sense of disillusionment and anxiety that characterized the early 20th century. The horrors of war, the rapid pace of industrialization, and the growth of impersonal urban centers all contributed to a sense of uncertainty and despair. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="about-author">About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>T.S. Eliot</strong> (1888-1965) was a highly influential American-born British poet, playwright, and literary critic. Widely regarded as one of the most important modernist poets of the 20th century, Eliot's work explored themes of alienation, spiritual emptiness, and the search for meaning in a fragmented world.  "Morning at the Window," written early in his career, reflects his growing disillusionment with modern life and foreshadows the darker and more complex themes that would dominate his later masterpieces, such as "The Waste Land."
