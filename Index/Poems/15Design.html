    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      "Design," a sonnet by Robert Frost, is a chilling exploration of nature's darker side and challenges the traditional notion of a benevolent creator. Published in 1922, the poem utilizes seemingly innocent imagery—a spider, a moth, and a flower—to confront the unsettling reality of death and the possibility of a malevolent force behind it.  
    </p>

    <h2 id="poem">Poem</h2>
    <div class="poem-container">
      I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,<br>
      On a white heal-all, holding up a moth<br>
      Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth--<br>
      Assorted characters of death and blight<br>
      Mixed ready to begin the morning right,<br>
      Like the ingredients of a witches’ broth--<br>
      A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,<br>
      And dead wings carried like a paper kite.<br>
      What had that flower to do with being white,<br>
      The wayside blue and innocent heal-all?<br>
      What brought the kindred spider to that height,<br>
      Then steered the white moth thither in the night?<br>
      What but design of darkness to appall?--<br>
      If design govern in a thing so small.

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem opens with the speaker's observation of a white spider on a white flower, holding a dead white moth. This unusual, all-white tableau immediately sets an unsettling tone. The spider, described as "fat" and "dimpled," is clearly a predator, further emphasized by the comparison of the moth to "rigid satin cloth," suggesting a lifeless corpse.
      <br><br>
      The speaker questions the seemingly orchestrated nature of this encounter, drawing a comparison to a witch's brew with its deadly ingredients.  The white spider, the white flower ("heal-all"), and the dead white moth are presented as a chilling spectacle of death and decay.
      <br><br>
      The poem shifts to a series of questions in the sestet, challenging the traditional view of a benevolent natural world. The speaker wonders why the typically blue "heal-all" is white in this instance, and what force brought the spider and moth together. The unsettling conclusion suggests that a "design of darkness" might be at play, even in seemingly insignificant events.
    </p>

    <h2 id="structure-style">Structure and Style</h2>
    <p>
      "Design" is a sonnet, a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme. Frost adheres to the Italian or Petrarchan sonnet form, which divides the poem into an octave (eight lines) and a sestet (six lines). The octave describes the scene and sets up the questions that the sestet will explore.
      <br><br>
      The poem utilizes traditional iambic pentameter, but Frost skillfully manipulates the meter to create pauses and emphasis, adding to the poem's ominous tone. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Frost employs a variety of poetic techniques to create a sense of unease and to explore the poem’s themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Imagery:</strong> Vivid descriptions like "dimpled spider," "rigid satin cloth," and "witches' broth" create a disturbing and memorable scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Symbolism:</strong> The color white, typically associated with purity and innocence, takes on a sinister meaning in the poem, representing death and the absence of light. The spider symbolizes predatory nature, while the moth, fragile and delicate, represents the victim.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rhetorical Questions:</strong> The series of questions in the sestet forces the reader to confront the disturbing implications of the scene. By questioning the motives behind this natural encounter, Frost challenges conventional understandings of the natural world and the idea of a benevolent God.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
    <p>
      "Design" grapples with several profound themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature's Indifference:</strong> The poem challenges the romantic notion of a harmonious natural world, presenting nature as a place where death and predation are commonplace.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem of Evil:</strong> Frost raises questions about the existence of evil in the world and the possibility of a malevolent force behind it. If a benevolent God created the world, why does such casual cruelty exist?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Uncertainty and Doubt:</strong> The poem leaves the reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty.  There are no easy answers to the questions posed, and the poem ends on a note of ambiguity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="about-author">About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Robert Frost</strong> (1874-1963) was one of America’s most beloved poets, known for his depictions of rural life and his exploration of complex philosophical themes. While often celebrated for his accessible language and traditional forms, poems like "Design" reveal a darker and more unsettling aspect of his work. "Design" is a testament to Frost's ability to use simple imagery and familiar settings to confront profound and unsettling questions about the nature of existence.
