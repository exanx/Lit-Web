    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      "Money" is a poem by Philip Larkin, written in 1973 during a period of economic uncertainty and shifting societal values brought on by the Oil Crisis. The poem explores the complex relationship between money and happiness, questioning the allure of consumerism and highlighting the ephemeral nature of material wealth.
    </p>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem is a first-person narrative in which the speaker reflects on his ambivalent attitude towards money. He describes money's mocking voice, urging him to spend it on material goods and experiences. The speaker observes how others seem to find fulfillment through spending, achieving a seemingly idyllic life with houses, cars, and families. However, he contemplates the fleeting nature of these possessions and the ultimate emptiness they might bring. He suggests that true fulfillment lies not in accumulating wealth but in embracing life's simple pleasures and accepting its inherent sadness.

    <h2 id="analysis">Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Let's examine some key lines and their interpretations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>**"Quarterly, is it, money reproaches me: / ‘Why do you let me lie here wastefully?’"** - The opening lines establish money as a personified entity, chiding the speaker for his frugality. The use of "quarterly" suggests a regular, insistent voice of consumerism, reminding him to spend.</li>
      <li>**"I am all you never had of goods and sex. / You could get them still by writing a few cheques."** - Here, money equates itself with unfulfilled desires, tempting the speaker with the promise of material possessions and sexual gratification, attainable through spending.</li>
      <li>**"So I look at others, what they do with theirs: / They certainly don’t keep it upstairs. / By now they’ve a second house and car and wife"** - The speaker observes those who readily embrace consumerism, seemingly achieving happiness through acquiring material goods and expanding their families. This highlights the societal pressure to conform to these values.</li>
      <li>**"I think of all the good I could do with it /  bank your screw /  a final unfreshing /  of a cold rinsed face / a cuppa in the morning,  a radio, a good snooze"** - This stanza reflects the speaker's alternative vision of happiness. It suggests that true contentment lies in simple pleasures and everyday comforts, rather than extravagant spending.</li>
      <li>**"and someone comes to bowl you over / or to let your tyres down"** - These lines introduce a sense of vulnerability and the potential for misfortune, regardless of one's wealth. It underscores the unpredictable nature of life and the limitations of material security.</li>
      <li>**"Maybe I’ll get a  couples of girls to cheer me up  /  find somewhere to  park /  get some booze in"** -  This stanza presents a more cynical view of happiness, achieved through fleeting pleasures and distractions. It suggests a sense of disillusionment and a search for temporary fulfillment.</li>
      <li>**"and then I think,  oh Christ,  /  and the trap closes"** - The final lines convey a feeling of resignation and entrapment. The speaker recognizes the allure of consumerism but ultimately understands its limitations and the potential for it to lead to a meaningless existence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="devices">Literary Devices</h2>
    <p>
      Larkin employs various literary devices to convey his message:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Personification:** Money is given a voice, reproaching and tempting the speaker, highlighting its power and influence over human desires.</li>
      <li>**Irony:** The poem's title, "Money," suggests a straightforward exploration of wealth, but the poem actually critiques the pursuit of material possessions as a path to happiness.</li>
      <li>**Conversational Tone:** The use of colloquial language and everyday imagery creates a relatable and accessible voice, reflecting the universality of the themes.</li>
      <li>**Enjambment:** The frequent use of enjambment, particularly in the final stanza, mirrors the cluttered and mundane nature of a life focused on acquiring possessions.</li>
      <li>**Rhyme Scheme:** The simple AABB rhyme scheme contributes to the poem's conversational tone and accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
