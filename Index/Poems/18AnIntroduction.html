    <h2 id="analysis">Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Let's examine some key lines and their interpretations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>**"I don’t know politics but I know the names / Of those who died, of those who killed"** - These opening lines establish the speaker's detachment from political complexities while simultaneously acknowledging the presence of violence and conflict in her society. Her knowledge is limited to names, suggesting a sense of distance and perhaps a feeling of powerlessness in the face of larger sociopolitical forces.</li>
      <li>**"I am Indian, very brown, born in / Malabar, I speak three languages, write in / Two, dream in one"** - This declaration proudly asserts the speaker's Indian identity and her multilingualism. The specific mention of "Malabar" further anchors her within a distinct cultural and geographical context. The reference to dreaming in one language hints at a deeper level of personal and subconscious connection.</li>
      <li>**"It is half English, half / Indian, funny perhaps, but it is honest"** - Here, the speaker addresses the criticism of writing in a language considered "foreign." She acknowledges the hybrid nature of her chosen language, recognizing its potential for humor but emphasizing its honesty as a means of self-expression.</li>
      <li>**"Don’t write in English, they said, / English is not your mother-tongue"** - This direct quote captures the disapproval and pressure faced by the speaker for choosing to write in English. It highlights the cultural and linguistic tensions within postcolonial societies where the legacy of colonialism continues to shape perceptions of identity and expression.</li>
      <li>**"I asked for love, not knowing what else to ask / For, my mother laughed, and my father / Everyone laughed, I was well married, they said"** - These lines poignantly reveal the speaker's yearning for love and her naivety in expressing it. The reactions of her parents and others highlight the societal constraints and expectations placed upon women, particularly in the context of arranged marriages where love is often seen as secondary to social and economic considerations.</li>
      <li>**"It is only that when I am alone / That I burn and the pearl snaps, it is only / That I grow to the size of the tree"** - This powerful imagery conveys the speaker's inner turmoil and her true self-expression when free from societal constraints. The burning and snapping pearl suggest a breaking free from imposed restrictions, while the growth to the size of a tree symbolizes her full potential and unfettered individuality.</li>
      <li>**"I too call myself I"** - This final line is a resounding assertion of self-identity. The repetition of "I" emphasizes the speaker's claim to her own individuality and her refusal to be defined by others or by societal expectations. It signifies her resilience and determination to forge her own path in life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="devices">Literary Devices</h2>
    <p>
      Das employs a variety of literary devices to convey the poem's themes and create a powerful impact on the reader:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Free Verse:** The poem's use of free verse allows for a natural and conversational flow, mirroring the speaker's stream of consciousness and her evolving thoughts on identity and self-expression. The absence of a strict rhyme scheme or meter enhances the poem's authenticity and emotional immediacy.</li>
      <li>**Direct Address:** The speaker frequently addresses the reader directly using the pronoun "you," creating a sense of intimacy and involving the reader in her personal journey and struggles. This technique breaks down the distance between the poet and the audience, fostering a deeper connection and understanding.</li>
      <li>**Imagery and Metaphor:** Das uses vivid imagery and metaphors to convey the speaker's internal state and her experiences. The burning and snapping pearl, the growth to the size of a tree, and the laughter of her family members all serve as powerful symbols that evoke a range of emotions and contribute to the poem's overall message.</li>
      <li>**Repetition:** The repetition of key words and phrases, such as "I" and "they said," emphasizes the speaker's struggle to assert her individuality against societal pressures and expectations. This technique amplifies her voice and highlights the ongoing tension between personal desires and societal constraints.</li>
      <li>**Tone and Diction:** The poem's tone shifts between defiance, vulnerability, and ultimately, self-assurance. Das's choice of diction is straightforward and conversational, reflecting the speaker's honesty and directness in confronting personal and societal challenges.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>**Language and Culture:** The poem addresses the challenges faced by writers who choose to express themselves in a language that is not considered their "mother tongue."
