    <h2 id="analysis">Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Let's examine some key lines and their interpretations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>**"Pretty women wonder where my secret lies."** - The poem opens with a direct address to "pretty women," acknowledging their curiosity about the speaker's magnetic presence. The use of the word "secret" suggests that the speaker's allure is not immediately apparent, setting the stage for an exploration of the qualities that contribute to her phenomenal nature. </li>
      <li>**"I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size / But when I start to tell them, / They think I'm telling lies."** - The speaker challenges conventional beauty standards by stating that she does not conform to the typical ideals of attractiveness. The fact that others doubt her explanation suggests that society often struggles to comprehend beauty that goes beyond superficial appearances. </li>
      <li>**"It's in the reach of my arms / The span of my hips, / The stride of my step, / The curl of my lips."** - Here, the speaker begins to enumerate the physical attributes that contribute to her confidence and appeal. These descriptions emphasize her physical presence and the way she carries herself in the world. The focus on movement and action suggests that her power lies not just in static beauty, but in her dynamic energy and vitality. </li>
      <li>**"I walk into a room / Just as cool as you please, / And to a man, / The fellows stand or / Fall down on their knees."** - This stanza depicts the speaker's commanding presence and the effect she has on others. Her entrance into a room is met with admiration and awe, suggesting that her confidence and self-assurance are palpable and irresistible.  </li>
      <li>**"Men themselves have wondered / What they see in me. / They try so much / But they can't touch / My inner mystery."** - The speaker acknowledges that even men are captivated by her allure, but they are unable to fully grasp the source of her power. The reference to "inner mystery" highlights the depth and complexity of her being, suggesting that her true essence lies beyond superficial observation. </li>
      <li>**"Now you understand / Just why my head's not bowed. / I don't shout or jump about / Or have to talk real loud."** - In the concluding stanza, the speaker reiterates her unwavering self-confidence and the quiet dignity with which she carries herself. She doesn't need to seek attention or validation from others; her phenomenal nature speaks for itself. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="devices">Literary Devices</h2>
    <p>
      Angelou employs a variety of literary devices to create a poem that is both impactful and memorable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Repetition and Anaphora:** The repeated use of "I say" and "It's in the" throughout the poem creates a rhythmic and emphatic tone, driving home the speaker's message of self-love and acceptance. The anaphora, or repetition of phrases at the beginning of lines, adds a sense of momentum and builds towards the poem's powerful conclusion. </li>
      <li>**Imagery and Sensory Language:** Angelou's vivid imagery engages the reader's senses, allowing them to experience the speaker's physicality and presence. Descriptions such as "the fire in my eyes," "the flash of my teeth," and "the swing in my waist" evoke a sense of vibrancy and energy, emphasizing the speaker's captivating allure. </li>
      <li>**Metaphor and Simile:** The poem utilizes metaphors and similes to create comparisons that enhance the reader's understanding of the speaker's phenomenal nature. Men are compared to "honey bees," drawn to the speaker's irresistible sweetness, while her confidence is likened to a "sun" that radiates warmth and power.  </li>
      <li>**Rhyme and Rhythm:** While the poem does not adhere to a strict rhyme scheme, Angelou uses rhyme selectively to create a sense of musicality and flow. The internal rhymes within lines, such as "please" and "knees," add to the poem's lyrical quality and emphasize key words and phrases. </li>
      <li>**Direct Address and Conversational Tone:** The speaker directly addresses the reader throughout the poem, creating a sense of intimacy and inviting them to share in her experience. The conversational tone, with its use of everyday language and colloquialisms, adds to the poem's accessibility and authenticity. </li>
    </ul>
