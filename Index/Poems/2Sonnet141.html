      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>"Sonnet 141"</strong> is one of 154 sonnets written by
        <strong>William Shakespeare</strong>. It belongs to the "Dark Lady"
        sequence, a group of sonnets addressed to a woman with whom the speaker
        has a complex and troubled relationship. The sonnet explores the themes
        of love, desire, reason, and the conflict between the heart and the mind.
      </p>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The speaker begins by stating that he does not love his mistress
        with his eyes, as they see many flaws in her. However, his heart
        loves her despite these flaws, defying his reason and senses.
        He acknowledges that she does not possess qualities that would
        typically attract him, but he remains inexplicably drawn to her,
        finding a strange pleasure in his own suffering.
      </p>

      <h3>Quatrain 1</h3>
      <p>
        <em>In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,</em><br />
        <em>For they in thee a thousand errors note;</em><br />
        <em>But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,</em><br />
        <em>Who, in despite of view, is pleas'd to dote.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker opens with a direct declaration: "In faith, I do not
          love thee with mine eyes." This sets up the central conflict of
          the sonnet—the disconnect between his reason and his
          emotions.
        </li>
        <li>
          He acknowledges that his eyes "a thousand errors note" in
          his mistress, suggesting that she is physically imperfect or
          perhaps even morally flawed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The turning point comes in the third line: "But 'tis my heart
          that loves what they despise." This highlights the
          <strong>paradox</strong> at the heart of his feelings: his heart
          loves her despite her flaws, going against the judgment of
          his eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final line emphasizes the heart's willful blindness,
          choosing to "dote" on her "in despite of view," meaning
          regardless of what his eyes see.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Quatrain 2</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;</em><br />
        <em>Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,</em><br />
        <em>Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited</em><br />
        <em>To any sensual feast with thee alone.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker continues to list the ways in which his mistress
          fails to meet conventional standards of beauty or attraction. Her
          voice does not delight his ears, nor does her touch appeal to
          his sense of feeling.
        </li>
        <li>
          He further emphasizes the lack of sensual attraction by stating
          that his senses of taste and smell have no desire to be
          "invited to any sensual feast" with her. This reinforces the
          idea that his love is not based on physical or superficial
          qualities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Quatrain 3</h3>
      <p>
        <em>But my five wits nor my five senses can</em><br />
        <em>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,</em><br />
        <em>Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,</em><br />
        <em>Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker acknowledges the powerlessness of both his
          "five wits" (intellect, imagination, fantasy, estimation,
          memory) and his "five senses" to dissuade his heart from
          loving her. This further underscores the irrationality of
          his love.
        </li>
        <li>
          He describes his heart as "foolish" for persisting in its
          devotion despite the lack of any logical reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final two lines contain a series of
          <strong>metaphors</strong> that depict the speaker's
          debasement in love. He becomes less than a man, a mere
          "slave and vassal wretch" to her "proud heart."
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Couplet</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Only my plague thus far I count my gain,</em><br />
        <em>That she that makes me sin awards me pain.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The couplet introduces a final <strong>paradox</strong>. The
          speaker finds a perverse "gain" in his "plague" of love.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pain she inflicts upon him, perhaps through her
          unfaithfulness or indifference, becomes a source of twisted
          pleasure. This could suggest a masochistic element to his
          love or a sense of self-punishment for succumbing to such an
          irrational passion.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final line also hints at a moral dimension, as he
          acknowledges that his love for her is a "sin." The nature
          of this sin is left ambiguous, but it could refer to her
          unworthiness as a love object or the adulterous nature of
          their relationship.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Paradox:</strong> The poem is built on a series of
          paradoxes, such as the speaker's heart loving what his eyes
          despise and his finding gain in his plague of love.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Metaphor:</strong> The speaker uses metaphors to
          describe his debasement in love, comparing himself to a
          slave and vassal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personification:</strong> The speaker's heart is
          personified as a separate entity with its own will and
          desires, capable of defying reason and the senses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The sonnet follows the traditional
          Shakespearean structure of three quatrains and a couplet, with a
          rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Imagery:</strong> The poem employs vivid imagery,
          particularly in the second quatrain, to emphasize the lack
          of sensual attraction the speaker feels for his mistress.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="author">About the Author</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>William Shakespeare</strong> (1564-1616) was an English
        poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer
        in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is
        often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His
        extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,
        154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some
        of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every
        major living language and are performed more often than those of
        any other playwright.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Irrationality of Love:</strong> The sonnet explores
          the idea that love can be irrational and defy logic and reason.
          The speaker's heart loves his mistress despite her flaws and
          the lack of any obvious attraction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Conflict Between Heart and Mind:</strong> There is a
          constant battle between the speaker's heart and mind. His heart
          leads him to love someone whom his mind knows is
          unworthy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Obsessive Love and Pain:</strong> The speaker's love
          borders on obsession, and he finds a strange pleasure in the
          pain she inflicts upon him. This suggests a complex
          psychological dynamic and perhaps a masochistic element to
          his love.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Love and Sin:</strong> The final line hints at a moral
          dimension to the speaker's love, suggesting that it is
          somehow sinful. This adds a layer of complexity and raises
          questions about the nature of their relationship and the
          social norms of the time.
