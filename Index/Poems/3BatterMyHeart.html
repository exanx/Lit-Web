      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>"Batter My Heart,"</strong> also known as
        <strong>"Holy Sonnet 14,"</strong> is a sonnet by the English metaphysical
        poet <strong>John Donne</strong>. Written in the early 17th century, it is a
        powerful expression of the speaker's struggle for spiritual
        renewal and his yearning for a more profound connection with God. The
        poem explores the complexities of faith, sin, and the paradoxical
        nature of divine love.
      </p>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The speaker addresses God, imploring him to forcefully break down the
        walls of his heart and claim him as his own. He acknowledges his own
        resistance to God's grace, comparing himself to a besieged town that
        refuses to surrender. He recognizes that his reason, his "viceroy,"
        has been captured by sin and is incapable of defending him against
        God's assault. Despite his love for God, he feels trapped in a
        spiritual impasse, "betrothed" to God's enemy. In a series of
        striking images, he begs God to "divorce," "untie," or "break" this
        bond and to take him prisoner, for only through such forceful
        intervention can he attain true freedom and spiritual purity.

      <h3>Line 1</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Batter my heart, three-person'd God; for you</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The poem opens with a forceful and unconventional plea: "Batter my
          heart." This violent image immediately sets the tone for the
          speaker's desperate yearning for spiritual transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The speaker directly addresses God, referred to as
          "three-person'd God," invoking the Holy Trinity—Father, Son,
          and Holy Spirit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 2</h3>
      <p>
        <em>As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker contrasts the violence of his request with God's
          gentler approach: "knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend."
          These verbs suggest a patient and subtle wooing, yet the
          speaker finds this insufficient.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 3</h3>
      <p>
        <em>That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker desires a more radical intervention, one that will
          "o'erthrow" and "bend" him, breaking down his resistance and
          forcing him to submit to God's will.
        </li>
        <li>
          The paradoxical combination of "rise" and "stand" with
          "o'erthrow" and "bend" emphasizes the speaker's need for
          both strength and humility in his relationship with God.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 4</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker continues to use violent imagery, urging God to
          "break, blow, burn" in order to "make me new." This suggests
          a complete purging and purification, a radical transformation
          that requires divine power.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 5</h3>
      <p>
        <em>I, like an usurp'd town, to another due,</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker introduces an extended
          <strong>metaphor</strong>, comparing himself to "an usurp'd
          town," a town that rightfully belongs to another but is
          currently under enemy control.
        </li>
        <li>
          This metaphor highlights the speaker's sense of being held
          captive by sin, alienated from God.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 6</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Labour to admit you, but oh, to no end.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker acknowledges his efforts to "admit" God into his
          heart, but these efforts are futile—"to no end." This
          suggests a deep-seated resistance, a stubborn refusal to
          surrender.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 7</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker identifies the source of his resistance: "Reason."
          He personifies reason as God's "viceroy," a representative
          who should be defending God's interests within him.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 8</h3>
      <p>
        <em>But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          However, reason has been "captiv'd" by sin and is now
          "weak or untrue." This suggests that the speaker's intellect
          has been compromised and is incapable of guiding him
          towards spiritual salvation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 9</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Yet dearly I love you, and would be lov'd fain,</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Despite his resistance, the speaker affirms his love for
          God: "Yet dearly I love you." This introduces a
          <strong>paradox</strong>, as he loves God yet remains separated
          from him.
        </li>
        <li>
          He also expresses his desire to reciprocate God's love:
          "and would be lov'd fain," meaning gladly or willingly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 10</h3>
      <p>
        <em>But am betroth'd unto your enemy:</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker explains the obstacle to his union with God: he
          is "betroth'd unto your enemy." This suggests a prior
          commitment to sin or worldly desires that prevents him from
          fully embracing God.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 11</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker pleads with God to intervene and sever this
          bond, using a series of verbs that suggest forceful
          separation: "Divorce me, untie or break that knot."
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 12</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Take me to you, imprison me, for I,</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The speaker paradoxically asks God to "imprison" him,
          recognizing that only through such confinement can he find
          true freedom.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 13</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          This line emphasizes the paradox of spiritual freedom
          through surrender: "Except you enthrall me, never shall be
          free."
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Line 14</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.</em>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The final line concludes with the most startling and
          provocative image: "Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me."
          This metaphor of spiritual "ravishment" suggests that only
          through God's overwhelming and irresistible love can the
          speaker attain spiritual purity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Metaphor:</strong> The poem employs several extended
          metaphors, most notably the comparison of the speaker to a
          besieged town and the paradoxical images of imprisonment and
          ravishment as means of attaining freedom and purity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paradox:</strong> The poem is rife with paradoxes,
          highlighting the complexities of faith and the unconventional
          nature of the speaker's relationship with God. For example, he
          asks God to break him down in order to build him up, to
          imprison him in order to set him free.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personification:</strong> Reason is personified as God's
          "viceroy," suggesting that even the speaker's intellect is
          subject to the forces of sin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The sonnet follows the Italian or
          Petrarchan structure, consisting of an octave (eight lines)
          and a sestet (six lines), with a rhyme scheme of ABBAABBA
          CDCDCD.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Imagery:</strong> The poem utilizes vivid and often
          violent imagery, evoking a sense of urgency and desperation
          in the speaker's plea. Words like "batter," "break,"
          "blow," "burn," "enthrall," and "ravish" create a powerful
          emotional impact.
        </li>

      <p>
        <strong>John Donne</strong> (1572-1631) was an English poet and
        cleric, considered the preeminent representative of the
        metaphysical poets. Donne's poetry is characterized by its
        intellectual complexity, its use of unconventional imagery and
        conceits, and its exploration of profound philosophical and
        religious themes. His work often reflects the tensions and
        contradictions of his time, grappling with issues of faith, doubt,
        love, death, and the human condition.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Spiritual Struggle and Renewal:</strong> The poem
          depicts the speaker's intense struggle for spiritual
          renewal, his desire to break free from the bonds of sin and
          experience a profound transformation through God's grace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Paradox of Divine Love:</strong> The poem explores
          the paradoxical nature of divine love, suggesting that true
          freedom and purity can only be attained through surrender
          and submission to God's overwhelming power. The speaker
          recognizes that his own efforts are insufficient and that he
          requires God's forceful intervention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Conflict Between Reason and Faith:</strong> The
          poem highlights the tension between reason and faith. The
          speaker's intellect, personified as God's "viceroy," is
          incapable of defending him against the allure of sin. He
          must relinquish his reliance on reason and embrace the
          irrationality of faith.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Nature of Sin:</strong> Sin is depicted as a powerful
          force that holds the speaker captive, preventing him from
          experiencing true freedom and communion with God. He
          recognizes his own complicity in his spiritual impasse,
          comparing himself to a besieged town that refuses to
          surrender.
