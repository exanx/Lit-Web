      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        "To the Memory of Mr. Oldham" is a poem by John Dryden, written as an
        elegy to commemorate the untimely death of the young poet John Oldham.
        Dryden expresses his grief and admiration for Oldham's satirical talent,
        comparing him to renowned figures from classical literature and lamenting
        the loss of his potential.

      <h2 id="analysis">Line by Line Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Farewell, too little, and too lately known,</strong><br />
        This opening line sets the mournful tone of the poem, expressing the
        speaker's regret for the short time he knew Oldham and the realization that
        their acquaintance ended prematurely.
        <br />
        <strong>Whom I began to think and call my own:</strong><br />
        This line highlights the growing bond between Dryden and Oldham,
        suggesting a sense of mentorship and shared literary kinship. The
        speaker's use of the possessive pronoun "my" emphasizes the personal
        loss he feels.
        <br />
        <strong>For sure our souls were near allied, and thine</strong><br />
        <strong>Nor kept the laws of time, nor bounds of line.</strong><br />
        These lines express a belief in a spiritual connection between the two
        poets, transcending physical limitations. The use of the metaphors "laws
        of time" and "bounds of line" suggest that their shared passion for poetry
        united them beyond the constraints of age and social standing.
        <br />
        <strong>Thou hadst a soul 'twas fitter to inspire</strong><br />
        <strong>Than to be bound by metre, or by rhyme.</strong><br />
        These lines praise Oldham's natural poetic talent, suggesting that his
        innate ability exceeded the technicalities of verse. Dryden implies that
        Oldham's potential was boundless and his spirit soared beyond the confines
        of conventional poetic forms.
        <br />
        <strong>Loosely, but strongly, flowed the numbers forth,</strong><br />
        <strong>When in the first heat of thy generous worth,</strong><br />
        <strong>They were struck out: at noble heat and rage</strong><br />
        <strong>Didst thou in thy first youth engage;</strong><br />
        These lines describe the raw power and passion of Oldham's early poetry.
        The imagery of "flowed" and "struck out" conveys a sense of
        spontaneity and unrestrained creativity, while the phrases "generous
        worth" and "noble heat" emphasize the sincerity and intensity of Oldham's
        writing.
        <br />
        <strong>Above the trifling cares, and low design,</strong><br />
        <strong>Which those should mind who courted so much thine.</strong><br />
        These lines contrast Oldham's lofty aspirations with the petty concerns of
        other writers who sought his approval. Dryden implies that Oldham's
        artistic integrity set him apart from those who were motivated by fame or
        social climbing.
        <br />
        <strong>Amazing strength was in thy untamed youth,</strong><br />
        <strong>Thy generous fury, kind as raging fire.</strong><br />
        These lines reiterate the forcefulness of Oldham's youthful talent,
        characterized by a "generous fury" that burned with passion and
        sincerity. The paradoxical comparison to "raging fire" suggests that
        Oldham's intensity was both powerful and benevolent.
        <br />
        <strong>But surely it was something more than rage</strong><br />
        <strong>Which from thy birth did animate thy stage.</strong><br />
        These lines acknowledge that Oldham's poetic drive stemmed from a deeper
        source than mere anger or rebellion. Dryden suggests that his talent was
        innate and destined for greatness from the beginning.
        <br />
        <strong>Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,</strong><br />
        <strong>Still showed a quickness; and maturing time</strong><br />
        <strong>But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.</strong><br />
        These lines lament the premature loss of Oldham's potential, comparing his
        works to "generous fruits" harvested before they reached full ripeness.
        Dryden implies that time would have refined Oldham's talent, but also
        acknowledges the inherent limitations of conventional poetry, referring to
        it as the "dull sweets of rhyme."
      </p>
      <p>
        The poem continues with allusions to Virgil's
        <em>Aeneid</em>, comparing Oldham to Nisus and Marcellus, figures who also
        met untimely deaths. Dryden uses these classical references to elevate
        Oldham's status and universalize the theme of loss.
