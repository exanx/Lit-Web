    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" is a poignant and concise poem by William Wordsworth, written in 1798 and published in the 1800 edition of *Lyrical Ballads*. Often categorized as one of the "Lucy poems," it explores the speaker's evolving perception of "Lucy," particularly before and after her passing. The poem delves into themes of nature, humanity, mortality, and the sublime, achieving a powerful impact through its stark simplicity.

    <div class="poem-container">
      A slumber did my spirit seal;<br>
      I had no human fears:<br>
      She seemed a thing that could not feel<br>
      The touch of earthly years.
      <br><br>
      No motion has she now, no force;<br>
      She neither hears nor sees;<br>
      Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course,<br>
      With rocks, and stones, and trees. 
    </div>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The poem begins with the speaker describing a time when their spirit was "sealed," suggesting a state of blissful ignorance about human vulnerability. During this period, the speaker perceived "Lucy" as someone who existed beyond the reach of time and decay. However, the second stanza reveals a stark shift in perception. Lucy's death has brought a harsh realization: she is now motionless, devoid of senses, and fully absorbed into the relentless cycles of nature. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="structure-style">Structure and Style</h2>
    <p>
      "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" is structured into two distinct quatrains (four-line stanzas). Each stanza contributes to the poem's overall meaning:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza 1:</strong> Focuses on the speaker's past perception of Lucy, portraying her as almost ethereal and impervious to the effects of time. The rhyme scheme (seal-feel, fears-years) creates a subtle dissonance, mirroring the speaker's initial naivete about mortality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stanza 2:</strong> Presents a stark contrast, emphasizing Lucy's physical state after death. The rhyme scheme (force-course, sees-trees) feels more harmonious, reflecting the speaker's acceptance of Lucy's integration with the natural world.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The poem's language is simple and direct, reflecting Wordsworth's characteristic style. This simplicity enhances the poem's emotional impact, allowing the reader to focus on the profound shift in the speaker's understanding.
    </p>

    <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Wordsworth masterfully employs several poetic techniques to convey the poem's meaning:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Metrical Variation:</strong> While the poem generally follows an iambic tetrameter pattern, there are subtle variations in the meter, particularly in the second stanza. These variations highlight the shift from the speaker's initial idealized perception of Lucy to the stark reality of her physical death. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Figurative Language:</strong> The phrase "spirit seal" is a powerful metaphor, symbolizing the speaker's previous blindness to human fragility. "Earthly years" represents the mundane, emphasizing the contrast between the speaker's initial perception of Lucy and the reality of her mortality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emphasis:</strong> The word "diurnal" is strategically placed, emphasizing the routine, mechanical force of nature. Lucy is no longer a separate entity but a part of this indifferent, all-encompassing cycle.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
    <p>
      "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" explores several interconnected themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature and Humanity:</strong> The poem contrasts Lucy's existence as a "creature of nature" with the speaker's human consciousness. After death, Lucy becomes indistinguishable from the natural world, while the speaker remains separate, grappling with the implications of her passing. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Sublime:</strong> The poem evokes a sense of the sublime, the awe-inspiring power and indifference of nature. Lucy, as nature's child, is idealized, untouched by the passage of "earthly years." This contrast with the speaker's human perspective highlights the unattainable, almost spiritual quality of Lucy's existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mortality:</strong> The poem confronts the inevitability of death and the profound shift in perception that accompanies loss. The speaker moves from a state of denial, believing Lucy to be eternal, to a stark acceptance of her physical demise. 
      </li>
    </ul>
